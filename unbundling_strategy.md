# The "Unbundle" Strategy: Which Tools to Spin Off?

You asked which tools to **remove and build separately**.

**My Advice:** Do not *remove* them from ToolHub yet. Keep them here as "lead magnets." However, you should absolutely **CLONE** the best ones into their own dedicated domains (e.g., `PassportPhotoGenius.com` or `FastResume.io`).

Here are the **Top 3 Candidates** to niche down on, ranked by profit potential.

## 🥇 Candidate #1: The "Passport & Visa Photo" Tool
*(Derived from: `image-to-kb`, `image-crop`, `background-remover`)*

*   **Why**: This is the "Holy Grail" of utility tools.
    *   **High Urgency**: People *need* this for government forms immediately.
    *   **High Volume**: Millions of applicants (India, Nigeria, US, UK) every month.
    *   **Monetization**: People will happily pay $1-$5 to ensure their photo isn't rejected, or view high-value ads.
*   **Niche Angles**:
    *   "US Visa Photo Maker"
    *   "Indian Passport Photo Resizer (50kb)"
    *   "Diversity Visa (Green Card) Photo Tool"
*   **Verdict**: **Build this separately.** It needs specific features (face centering guides, country checklists) that clutter a general tool hub.

## 🥈 Candidate #2: The "Resume / CV Builder"
*(Current tool: `CV Builder`)*

*   **Why**: It's an outlier. It's not a "quick fix" tool like an image compressor; it's a "creation" tool.
    *   **Complexity**: Users spend 20-40 minutes here.
    *   **RPM (Ad Revenue)**: VERY high. Advertisers are job recruiters, universities, and certification courses ($$).
*   **Why removing might make sense**: It feels "heavy" compared to a simple "JPG to PNG" tool. It deserves a distraction-free, full-screen experience.
*   **Niche Angle**: "Simple Markdown Resume Builder" (for devs) or "No-Signup CV Maker".

## 🥉 Candidate #3: The "Invoice Generator"
*(Current tool: `Invoice Generator`)*

*   **Why**: B2B (Business to Business) traffic.
    *   **Audience**: Freelancers, small business owners.
    *   **Ad Value**: Extremely high. Banks, credit cards, and accounting software (QuickBooks, Xero) pay huge money for these keywords.
*   **Niche Angle**: "Freelance Invoice Generator PDF".

## ❌ Tools to KEEP on ToolHub (Do Not Spin Off)

*   **Image Compressors / Converters**: Keep these together. They feed off each other. Someone resizing an image might also need to convert it. They work best as a "suite."
*   **PDF Tools**: Only spin this off if you want to compete directly with *iLovePDF* (which is brutal). Better to keep them as a value-add here.

## Summary Strategy

1.  **Keep everything on ToolHub** for now to build domain authority.
2.  **Pick ONE niche** (Recommendation: **Passport/Visa Photo**) to build as a flagship separate product.
3.  **Cross-promote**: Use ToolHub to send traffic to your specialized "Pro" site, and vice versa.
